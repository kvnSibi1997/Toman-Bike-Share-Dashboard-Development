**Project Description: Toman Bike Share Dashboard Development**

**Objective:**
Developed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard for Toman Bike Share to provide key performance metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making for the company. The dashboard was designed to analyse hourly revenue, profit and revenue trends, seasonal revenue, and rider demographics.
Key Features:
•	Hourly Revenue Analysis: Visualized peak revenue hours, identifying midday and early evening as the most profitable times, with Wednesday and Friday showing the highest sales.
•	Profit and Revenue Trends: Tracked historical profit and revenue trends to identify growth patterns and areas for improvement.
•	Seasonal Revenue: Analysed revenue fluctuations across different seasons to optimize resource allocation and marketing strategies.
•	Rider Demographics: Provided insights into rider demographics to tailor marketing campaigns and improve customer engagement.

**Design and Aesthetics:**
The dashboard was designed using Toman Bike Share's company colours, ensuring brand consistency. The interface was user-friendly and easy to navigate, allowing stakeholders to access critical data effortlessly.
Data Source:
Utilized the company's database to extract and analyze relevant data. In cases where data was unavailable, a mock database was created to simulate real-world scenarios.

**Recommendations:**
•	Pricing Strategy: Proposed a conservative price increase of 10-15% for the upcoming year, based on market analysis and customer feedback. Suggested a segmented pricing strategy for casual versus registered users to maximize revenue without losing customers.
•	Market Analysis: Recommended further market research to understand customer satisfaction and competitive dynamics, ensuring the pricing strategy aligns with market conditions.
Conservative Increase: Considering the substantial increase last year, a more conservative increase might be prudent to avoid hitting a price ceiling where demand starts to drop. An increase in the range of 10-15% could test the market’s response without risking a significant loss of customers.
Price Setting:
•	If the price in 2022 was $4.99, a 10% increase would make the new price about $5.49.
•	A 15% increase would set the price at approximately $5.74.

**Recommended Strategy:**
Market Analysis: Conduct further market research to understand customer satisfaction, potential competitive changes, and the overall economic environment. This can guide whether leaning towards the lower or higher end of the suggested increase.
Segmented Pricing Strategy: Consider different pricing for casual versus registered users, as they may have different price sensitivities.
Monitor and Adjust: Implement the new prices but be ready to adjust based on immediate customer feedback and sales data. Monitoring closely will allow you to fine-tune your pricing strategy without committing fully to a price that might turn out to be too high.

**Outcome:**
The dashboard provided actionable insights, helping Toman Bike Share optimize its operations and pricing strategy. The project demonstrated my ability to transform raw data into meaningful visualizations and strategic recommendations, contributing to the company's growth and profitability.
Skills Utilized:
•	Data Analysis and Visualization
•	Dashboard Development
•	Market Research and Pricing Strategy
•	Database Management
•	Stakeholder Communication**
